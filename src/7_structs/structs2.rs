Key Learnings
1. Struct Update Syntax Mastery
Through this exercise, I gained a deeper understanding of Rustâ€™s struct update syntax. 
This feature is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of new struct instances by leveraging existing ones. 
By using this syntax, I learned how to efficiently initialize new structs without manually specifying each field, especially when many fields remain unchanged from one instance to another.

2. Efficient Code Practices
Initially, I instantiated several fields by repeatedly calling create_order_template(). 
Through trial and error, I learned that this approach was inefficient. 
It was a practical demonstration of how repeated function calls can lead to redundant code and unnecessary computation. 
The exercise guided me to utilize a single template instance (order_template) for all fields not explicitly set, teaching me a more efficient coding practice.
