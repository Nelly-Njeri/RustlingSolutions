# Rustlings Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Rustlings exercises. Rustlings is an excellent collection of exercises designed to help you learn Rust by solving small coding problems.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress as I work through the Rustlings exercises. Each section contains different exercises that help to understand and practice various concepts in Rust.

## Sections
So far, I have solved the following sections:

1. **Variables**
    - Understanding variable declaration, type annotations, mutable variables, shadowing, and constants.

2. **Functions**
    - Learning function definitions, parameters, return types, and how to use expressions and statements.

3. **If**
    - Exploring `if` statements, the most basic form of control flow in Rust.
    - [Control Flow - if expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#if-expressions)

4. **Primitive Types**
    - Delving into Rust's basic types that are essential for effective programming.
    - [Data Types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-02-data-types.html)
    - [The Slice Type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch04-03-slices.html)

5. **Vectors**
    - Understanding Vectors, dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink at runtime.
    - [Storing Lists of Values with Vectors](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch08-01-vectors.html)
    - [`iter_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.iter_mut)
    - [`map`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map)

6. **Move Semantics**
    - Learning about ownership, references, and borrowing which are foundational to Rust's memory safety guarantees.
    - [Ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html)
    - [Reference and borrowing](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html)
## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:
   
    git clone https://github.com/Nelly-Njeri/RustlingSolutions.git

    cd Rustlings-Solutions

2. **Navigate to the topic folder** you are interested in:
   
    cd variables
   

3. **Open and review the exercise solutions** 

to compare with your own solutions or to seek guidance.

By following along with these solutions, you can see how I approached each exercise and understand the concepts in Rust more deeply. Happy coding! ðŸš€
